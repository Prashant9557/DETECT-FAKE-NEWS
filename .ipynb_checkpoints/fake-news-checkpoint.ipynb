Not only that, but Colbert had to admit something terrible   that he and white supremacists have one thing in common, they are absolutely disappointed in Trump   albeit clearly for different reasons.The Late Show host even pointed out that Trump will blame everything on being rigged if it doesn t go his way.

And YOU know it.  Ernie Page (@AngryHatter) November 20, 2017What?! This man is a child in a rumpled suit. In case you haven t noticed, hardly anybody likes him. : Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.  pic.twitter.com/ntJzgkdWdz  DEMOS..We the people (@Windemere22) November 20, 2017China should have thrown #Dotard @realDonaldTrump into the slammer, chucked the key into the bog & flushed it away.  Holger  \\\\_( )_/  (@hnelke1973) November 20, 2017No. @realDonaldTrump has no idea what it means to do good for the sake of doing good. He is an empty shell of a man with no moral compass. Also not my favorite president.  Doreen Graham (@DoreeGraham) November 20, 2017Absolutely not. The fact that our narcissistic baby in chief can t take any criticism without lashing out is disgraceful.

And Fox News needs to stop feeding his bullshit.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images', 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday warned Iraq and the Kurds against taking any steps that might destabilize the Middle East after a Kurdish independence referendum, encouraging both sides to hold talks to find a solution within the framework of a single Iraqi state. The Russian Foreign Ministry, in the same statement, also said that while Moscow respected the Kurds  national ambitions it favored preserving the territorial integrity of Iraq. ', \"House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R., La.) threw a strike in his ceremonial first pitch at the Washington National s opening-round playoff game Friday night, which was also his birthday.Scalise was shot in the hip and nearly died in June and he had to throw from a walker but he had no trouble delivering a perfect pitch to Capitol police special agent David Bailey, who was also injured in the shooting.After taking a bullet on a field in Alexandria, Va., Scalise was visibly happy to return to the diamond, and he expressed his gratefulness on Twitter after.What a memorable birthday!

It s only strengthened my faith in God, and it s really crystallized what shows up as the goodness in people,  he said.  I got to see that goodness in people, and so while some people might focus on a tragic event and an evil act, to me, all I ll remember are the thousands of acts and kindness and love that came out of this.

In addition, if Trump were to decide to angry-tweet Colbert in retaliation, you know that Colbert would wear that Twitter fit as a badge of honor, as he should.Absolutely annihilating Trump, his connection to Putin, the Russian prostitute story, the fact that he wants to take a mini-vacation after the inauguration, and the fact that, well, he s clearly full of sh*t, Colbert didn t hold back even bringing God, yes that God almighty with a gun, into the mix.Colbert even brought up the fact that Trump s approval ratings are absolutely pathetic, especially when compared to President Obama s approval rating upon entering office. Not only that, but Colbert had to admit something terrible   that he and white supremacists have one thing in common, they are absolutely disappointed in Trump   albeit clearly for different reasons.The Late Show host even pointed out that Trump will blame everything on being rigged if it doesn t go his way. Even if the weather is bad on Inauguration Day, that s clearly a conspiracy against him.Watch Colbert absolutely shred Trump here:Featured image via video screen capture'], 'label': [0, 0, 1, 0, 0]}\n"

In the assembly segment, she trailed by 48,000 votes. Notably, in the state elections, Ajit Pawar won against his grand-nephew Yogendra by a significant margin of 1,00,899 votes.\n"
